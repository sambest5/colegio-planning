TEACHER: Sam Best
UNIT: Trigonometry
GRADE: 12 

----------------------
CURRICULAR CONNECTIONS
----------------------
BIG IDEAS:
- Analyzing the characteristics of functions allows to solve equations and model and 
understand relationships
- Many functions are related through inverse operations
- Transformations of shapes extend to functions in all of their representations
- Understand how trigonometric equations can be solved using standard algebra techniques
- Understand the relationship between our trigonometric ratios and their corresponding functions.
- Understand that sinusoidal functions can be used to model many situations in the natural and man 
made world, and that these usually involve some type of circular motion 

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS:
- How are the algebraic techniques used in trigonometry related to past algebraic techniques 
learned and what are new/different ones?
- How can a trigonometric ratio be visualized on a Cartesian plane, and does this deepen our
understanding of what a trigonometric ratio is?
- Where can we find sinusoidal functions in our lives? Can we model these situations with a function?

CORE COMPETENCIES:
- Communication
- Creative Thinking
- Critical Thinking

CURRICULAR COMPETENCIES:
- Use reasoning and logic to analyze and apply mathematical ideas
- Demonstrate fluent and flexible thinking of number
- Model mathematics in contextualized experiences
- Communicate mathematical thinking in many ways
- Explain and justify mathematical ideas
set of graphical transformations.

CONTENT:
- Algebra in the context of trigonometric equations
- Using 'special triangles' to aid in solving trig equations
- Using data and our knowledge about sinusoidal functions to model a number of situations in everyday life.

----------
ASSESSMENT
----------
FORMATIVE:
- Intersperse all lectures with opportunities to recall what they have just been taught in order 
to reinforce their understanding, or make them aware of what they did not fully understand
- Provide practice problems of the variety they will be assessed on with the answers so they can 
check their own work and realize what they are doing wrong
- Before a formal assessment give them a 'pretend' quiz on which they will receive immediate 
feedback on how well they understand the concepts/can solve the problems.

REFLECTIVE:
- Provide partner assignments where they are required to solve a problem similar (but often with an 
extra challenge) to other's they have seen. The assignment requires them to explain to each other the
steps they would take, reinforcing their understanding and improving their communication skills.

SUMMATIVE:
- Quizzes based on subsections of the unit
- Test based on the entire unit
- Project on modelling the hours of daylight as it changes throughout the year

---------
RESOURCES
---------
- Lesson plans for each individual lesson based on the unit curriculum
- Workbook with practice exercises
- Group work assignments on graphing trig functions and modelling sinusoidal functions
- Quizzes and tests
