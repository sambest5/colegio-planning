TEACHER: Sam Best
UNIT: Rational Expressions
GRADE: 11

----------------------
CURRICULAR CONNECTIONS
----------------------
BIG IDEAS:
- Operations between algebraic expressions and equations are connected and allow us to make 
meaning through abstract thinking
- Functions allow us to model contextualized situations
- The theorems (rules) of algebra continue to apply in new situations, revealing a consistency and completeness found in the underlying structure of mathematics

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS:
- How are rational expressions similar to other mathematical expressions we've seen before?
How are they different? What new considerations do we have to take into account?
- Why is it important to be able to 'simplify' an expression?
- How many ways are there to simplify an expression? If there is more than one, how do we 
choose? What does this tell us about creative and abstract thinking in math?
- What type of word problems can be modelled and solved using rational equations?  

CORE COMPETENCIES:
- Communication
- Creative Thinking
- Critical Thinking

CURRICULAR COMPETENCIES:
- Use reasoning and logic to analyze and apply mathematical ideas
- Demonstrate fluent and flexible thinking of number
- Model mathematics in contextualized experiences
- Communicate mathematical thinking in many ways
- Explain and justify mathematical ideas

CONTENT:
- Rational Expressions and Equations

ASSESSMENT
----------
FORMATIVE:
- Intersperse all lectures with opportunities to recall what they have just been taught
in order to reinforce their understanding, or make them aware of what they did not fully understand
- Provide practice problems of the variety they will be assessed on with the answers so they
can check their own work and realize what they are doing wrong
- Before a formal assessment give them a 'pretend' quiz on which they will receive immediate
feedback on how well they understand the concepts/can solve the problems.

REFLECTIVE:
- Give students the opportunity during teaching to reflect on whether they could or did
solve a certain problem in a different way. 
- Provide partner assignments where they are required to solve a problem similar (but
often with an extra challenge) to other's they have seen. The assignment requires them 
to explain to each other the steps they would take, reinforcing their understanding and 
improving their communication skills.
- During teaching, ask students to reflect on whether they could solve the problem in a 
- Individual assignments in which they are permitted to work together as well as ask me 
any questions for clarification.

SUMMATIVE:
- Quizzes based on subsections of the unit
- Test based on the entire unit
- Assignment based on contextualized modelling of rational expressions
